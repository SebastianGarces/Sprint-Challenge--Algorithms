#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - although the while loop is running n * n * n, a = a + n * n, negating a n * n, therefore only runs n times.


b) O(n log n) - Due to the j *= 2, j is approaching to n in log n time, similar to doing n/2. For loop is O(n).


c) O(n) - Will count 2 ears n times recursively. 

## Exercise II

I would approach this with a binary sort, go to mid floor and through an egg, if it breaks, find lower mid and through again and so on. Top mid if it didn't break.

algorithm would be O(log n)
